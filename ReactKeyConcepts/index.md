### Why react exists?

1. Dont touch the DOM, ill do this (imperative and declarative)
2. Build websites like lego blocks (components)
   - But components are simply just JavaScript functions that receives some sort of input or attributes which we call props. And in return it returns this thing that kind of looks like HTML but inside of JavaScript. And these components can be built like this as a function or even as a class. But the key here is that based on the state and these components that we built, we have an entire component that we can add to our page and reuse maybe over here as well if we want it to. Just like Lego blocks.
